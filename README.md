# Advent of Code 2022: Go

I am a noob to Go! This year I want to use the AoC as an excuse to play with language. Hopefully my code doesn't make those experienced with Go queasy! :wink:

At first I thought I wrote a shitty solution with a bunch of if and else statements. So I wrote one using maps and it really reduced the amount of lines of code. However using go test benchmarking, I noticed the if else solution is much faster! I would be curious to try it with slices to see where this falls. So sometimes if else's might be more optimal, even if it's ugly! :wink:
